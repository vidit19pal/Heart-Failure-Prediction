# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure. Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help. 
The project consist of collecting & analysing the data, Feature selection & engineering the data, Outlier detection & treatment, Missing value detection & treatment and finally model building to check training & testing accuracy. Model building is done by using Machine Learning algorithms like logistics regression, decision tree, random forest, KNN, GNB, ADA Boost, XG Boost.
Maximum accuracy achieved is 89%.
